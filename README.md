## BinaBola

this application can detect and classify various plastic waste items using computer vision and a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model. By integrating this AI-powered recognition capability into the app, we can offer users real-time guidance on the appropriate recycling or disposal methods for each type of plastic. This will empower individuals to make more informed decisions and develop sustainable waste management habits.
